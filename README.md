# Card-game
I am creating a Go-Fish card game in Java.

# how to play
The user and the computer will get dealt seven cards, and the starting person will get chosen randomly. After the cards are dealt and the person going first is chosen, they can guess a card that is in their hand and they think is in the opponents hand as well. After that the other player takes his turn and so on and so forth. Once someone gets ten points (each set of four numbers is a book, and each book is a point) or the deck runs out, the game ends. When the game ends the person with the highest number of points wins, automatically the person with ten if they get that many.
